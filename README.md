## Whitepaper
Contains theoretical introduction to the problem and numerical way to describe . It is located in main directory. ML Data Format is described in there.

## Predicting Future Movement of Plants
This project contains generator in *data_generation* directory. Generated data is used as input for DML training. Model became overfited because of reasons that are listed in white paper. It predicts movement of bodies in training dataset well.

## Data Format
Data is transported between programs and scripts in this project via JSON format.
### ML Format
This is output format of generator and input format for ML it was created in a way that it is easy to just parse it after loading it into program.
### GUI Format
Contains same information as ML Format but is easier to process by GUI.
There is converter that will change ML Format into GUI format.

## Model
### Libraries
We use Keras (TensorFlow 2) library with GPU acceleration.

### Configuration
Model is built with input (16 linear neurons) layer, 4 hidden layers (500, 500, 500 and 750 relu neurons) with batch normalisation and dropout and one output layer (480 linear neurons).
